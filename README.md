# NESticle
The Source Code of the NESticle emulator. Created by Bloodlust Software. It was leaked in 1997 by MindRape.

# History
The NESticle emulator was made by Icer Addis which its source code was later leaked by Donald Moore (MindRape). In Early 2019, togemet2 released the source code to the public, and I decided to put the source code here with togemet2's permission.

## Can it be compiled?
I have no clue. We had several attempts at compiling. We're not even sure if this is a completed version!

If anyone's interested in helping us compile this source code to DOS/WIN9x or even Modern Windows, you can fork the code from this GitHub repository and make whatever changes you want with it.

## What are these zip files with cuss words containing more source code about?
I don't know, the best speculation we have that it's either full of versions that Addis, well, fucked up, or development versions.
